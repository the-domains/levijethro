# My Little Boy

No amount of gold could ever compare to the gift of love that my son shares.

I've been blind and I couldn't see that all the love I've wanted is right here in front of me.

He gives me reason to get through another day.

Maybe it's how he loves me in his special little way.

And when it gets hard for me to sleep at night....

He wraps his little arms around me and says God will make things right!

From sweet gentle touches to his bear hugs and a kiss...

He makes this hell on earth seem more like a peaceful bliss.

That great big kool-aid smile and the twinkle in his eyes....

Every time I look at him it makes me want to cry.

But they're not tears of sorrow; they're tears of pride and joy....

To know that all the love in heaven is wrapped around my little boy.
